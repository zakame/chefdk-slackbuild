chef-workstation (Chef Workstation, successor to Chef Development Kit)
-----------------------------

(Adapted from Pat Volkerding's original google-chrome SlackBuild.)

Here's how to install chef-workstation on Slackware.


First, go to the chef-workstation site:

https://downloads.chef.io/tools/workstation

Click the download button for the Ubuntu 20.04 release.


Read and accept the license terms, and download the .deb package.


Then, with the chef-workstation_$RELEASE_amd64.deb package in the same
directory as the chef-workstation.SlackBuild script, run the script as
root to convert the .deb to a Slackware .txz:

RELEASE=0.2.21-1 ./chef-workstation.SlackBuild

Change the RELEASE value to the same release number as the package as
needed.

This will produce a Slackware compatible .txz package.  The exact
version number in the package filename will depend on the version of
Chef Workstation in the .deb package, but it will be something like:
chef-workstation-0.2.21-x86_64-1zakame.txz

You'll find the output package in the /tmp directory.


Then, install the package (again as root):

cd /tmp
upgradepkg --install-new chef-workstation-0.2.21-x86_64-1zakame.txz

Do note that if you have an inspec package installed, this chef-workstation
package will overwrite the /usr/bin/inspec symlink installed by the
inspec package.

chef-workstation ships with inspec 2, so the standalone inspec package
can now be removed if previously installed.


Enjoy!  :-)
